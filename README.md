# Assignment 1 – NO₂ Data Analysis

learning a probability density function using a roll-number-parameterized non-linear transformation.

## Dataset
India Air Quality Dataset (NO₂ feature)

## Method
- NO₂ values were transformed using a sinusoidal non-linear function.
- A Gaussian probability density function was fitted to the transformed data.
- Parameters were estimated using standard statistical estimation.
